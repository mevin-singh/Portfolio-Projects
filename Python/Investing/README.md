Looking at the rates of returns, as a long term investor, Mondays would be best day to invest for me since I am not concerned with day-to-day changes in prices and prices seem to be lowest on Mondays. This also supports the Weekend Effect which is a phenomemon in which stock returns on Mondays are often significantly lower than those of the immediately preceding Friday.
