	WHERE cancellation = 0
),

arrival_times AS (
	SELECT
		runner_id,
		order_id,
		EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM (pickup_time - order_time)) + EXTRACT(SECOND FROM (pickup_time - order_time))/60  AS time_to_arrive

| 3         | 67.20                          |

Preparation time increases as the number of pizza in the order increases.

***

#### 4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
```sql
WITH combined AS (
	SELECT 
		customer_id,
		distance
	FROM customer_orders_cleaned

```
| customer_id | average_distance_km  |
| ----------- | -------------------  |
| 101         | 20.00                |

***

#### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
```sql
WITH combined AS (
	SELECT 
		DISTINCT order_id,
		duration_mins
	FROM customer_orders_cleaned
	INNER JOIN runner_orders_cleaned USING (order_id)
	WHERE cancellation = 0
)

SELECT 
	MAX(duration_mins) AS longest_delivery_mins,
	MIN(duration_mins) AS shortest_delivery_mins,
	MAX(duration_mins) - MIN(duration_mins) AS difference_mins
FROM combined
```
| longest_delivery_mins| shortest_delivery_mins | difference_mins |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| 40                   | 10                     |   30            |

***

#### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
```sql
WITH combined AS (
	SELECT 
		order_id,
		runner_id,
		distance,
		duration_mins/60 AS duration_hrs
	FROM customer_orders_cleaned
	INNER JOIN runner_orders_cleaned USING (order_id)
	-- order is only delivering then there is no cancellation
	WHERE cancellation = 0
)

SELECT 
    DISTINCT
	order_id,
	runner_id,
	-- average speed since total distance/total time and not avg aggregation function
	ROUND(distance/duration_hrs, 2) AS avg_speed_kmph
FROM combined
```
| order_id | runner_id | avg_speed_kmph |
| -------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| 1        | 1         | 37.50                |
| 2        | 1         | 44.44                |
| 3        | 1         | 40.20                |
| 4        | 2         | 35.10                |
| 5        | 3         | 40.00                |
| 7        | 2         | 60.00                |
| 8        | 2         | 93.60                |
| 10       | 1         | 60.00                | 

The max speed for runner 2 in order_id 8 is around 94 km/h which is very fast as compared to the other speeds. Safety should be emphasized during deliveries even if deliveries are late or delayed.

***

#### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
```sql
SELECT 
	runner_id,
	SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS succesful_orders,
	COUNT(*) AS n_orders,
	ROUND(CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NUMERIC)/CAST(COUNT(*) AS NUMERIC) * 100, 2) AS success_perc
FROM runner_orders_cleaned
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```
| runner_id | successful_orders  | n_orders | success_perc |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| 1         | 4                  | 4        | 100          |
| 2         | 3                  | 4        | 75           |

#### 2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?

#### - Add cheese is $1 extra

```sql
WITH COMBINED AS
	(SELECT PIZZA_NAME,
			EXTRAS
		FROM CUSTOMER_ORDERS_CLEANED
		INNER JOIN PIZZA_RUNNER.PIZZA_NAMES USING (PIZZA_ID)),
		
	NUM_PIZZAS AS
	(SELECT PIZZA_NAME,
			EXTRAS,
			COUNT(*) AS N_PIZZAS
		FROM COMBINED
		GROUP BY 1, 2),
		
	REVENUE AS
	(SELECT SUM(CASE
					WHEN PIZZA_NAME = 'Meatlovers' AND EXTRAS IS NOT NULL THEN N_PIZZAS * (12 + 1)
					WHEN PIZZA_NAME = 'Vegetarian' AND EXTRAS IS NOT NULL THEN N_PIZZAS * (10 + 1)
					WHEN PIZZA_NAME = 'Meatlovers' AND EXTRAS IS NULL THEN N_PIZZAS * 12
					ELSE N_PIZZAS * 10
					END) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
		FROM NUM_PIZZAS)
		
SELECT *
FROM REVENUE

#### 5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
```sql
WITH SUCCESSFUL_DELIVERIES AS
	(SELECT ORDER_ID,
			DISTANCE
		FROM RUNNER_ORDERS_CLEANED
		WHERE CANCELLATION = 0 ),
		
	COMBINED AS
	(SELECT PIZZA_NAME,
			COUNT(PIZZA_NAME) AS N_PIZZAS,
			SUM(DISTANCE) AS TOTAL_DISTANCE
		FROM CUSTOMER_ORDERS_CLEANED
		INNER JOIN PIZZA_RUNNER.PIZZA_NAMES USING (PIZZA_ID)
		INNER JOIN SUCCESSFUL_DELIVERIES USING (ORDER_ID)
		GROUP BY 1),
		
	REVENUE AS
	(SELECT SUM(CASE
					WHEN PIZZA_NAME = 'Meatlovers' THEN N_PIZZAS * 12 - TOTAL_DISTANCE * 0.3
					ELSE N_PIZZAS * 10 - TOTAL_DISTANCE * 0.3
					END) AS TOTAL_PROFIT
		FROM COMBINED)
		
SELECT *
FROM REVENUE
