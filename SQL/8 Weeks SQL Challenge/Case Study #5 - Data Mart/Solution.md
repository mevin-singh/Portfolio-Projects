## üßº A. Data Cleansing Steps
In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:
- Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format
- Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
- Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called `age_band` after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value:
  
| segment | age_band    |
|---------|-------------|
| 1       | Young Adults|
| 2       | Middle Aged |
| 3 or 4  | Retirees    |

  
- Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment` values:  
| segment | demographic | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| C | Couples |
| F | Families |

- Ensure all `null` string values with an "unknown" string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
- Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record
