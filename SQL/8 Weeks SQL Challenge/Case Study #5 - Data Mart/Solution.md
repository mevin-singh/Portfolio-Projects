All the information regarding the case study has been sourced from the following link: [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-5/)

## üßº A. Data Cleansing Steps
In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:
- Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format
- Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
- Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called `age_band` after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value:
  
| segment | age_band    |
|---------|-------------|
| 1       | Young Adults|
| 2       | Middle Aged |
| 3 or 4  | Retirees    |

  
- Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment` values:  
| segment | demographic | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| C | Couples |
| F | Families |

- Ensure all `null` string values with an "unknown" string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
- Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

```sql

## üßº C. Before & After Analysis
This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.
Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.
We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before
Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

**1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?**
```sql
WITH BASELINE AS
	(SELECT WEEK_DATE,
			WEEK_NUMBER,
			SUM(SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES
		FROM CLEAN_WEEKLY_SALES
		WHERE CALENDAR_YEAR = '2020'
		GROUP BY 1, 2),
		
	BEFORE_AFTER_CHANGE AS
	(SELECT SUM(CASE
					WHEN WEEK_NUMBER BETWEEN 21 AND 24 THEN TOTAL_SALES
					END) AS BEFORE_SALES,
			SUM(CASE
					WHEN WEEK_NUMBER BETWEEN 26 AND 29 THEN TOTAL_SALES
					END) AS AFTER_SALES
		FROM BASELINE),
		
	CHANGE_IN_SALES AS
	(SELECT AFTER_SALES,
			BEFORE_SALES,
			AFTER_SALES - BEFORE_SALES AS ABS_DIFF,
			ROUND((AFTER_SALES - BEFORE_SALES) / BEFORE_SALES * 100,
				2) AS PERC_CHANGE
		FROM BEFORE_AFTER_CHANGE)
		
SELECT *
FROM CHANGE_IN_SALES
```
| after_sales | before_sales | abs_diff | perc_change |
|-------------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| 2334905223  | 2345878357   | -10973134| -0.47       |

***

**2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?**
```sql
WITH BASELINE AS
	(SELECT WEEK_DATE,
			WEEK_NUMBER,
			SUM(SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES
		FROM CLEAN_WEEKLY_SALES
		WHERE CALENDAR_YEAR = '2020'
		GROUP BY 1, 2),
		
	BEFORE_AFTER_CHANGE AS
	(SELECT SUM(CASE
					WHEN WEEK_NUMBER BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN TOTAL_SALES
					END) AS BEFORE_SALES,
			SUM(CASE
					WHEN WEEK_NUMBER BETWEEN 26 AND 37 THEN TOTAL_SALES
					END) AS AFTER_SALES -- max week_number only 36 so missing 1 month as compared to before_sales
		FROM BASELINE),
		
	CHANGE_IN_SALES AS
	(SELECT AFTER_SALES,
			BEFORE_SALES,
			AFTER_SALES - BEFORE_SALES AS ABS_DIFF,
			ROUND((AFTER_SALES - BEFORE_SALES) / BEFORE_SALES * 100,
				2) AS PERC_CHANGE
		FROM BEFORE_AFTER_CHANGE)
		
SELECT *
FROM CHANGE_IN_SALES
```
| after_sales | before_sales | abs_diff | perc_change |
|-------------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| 6403922405  | 7126273147   | -722350742| -10.14      |

**3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?**
```sql
WITH BASELINE_2018 AS
	(SELECT WEEK_DATE,
			WEEK_NUMBER,
			SUM(SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES
		FROM CLEAN_WEEKLY_SALES
		WHERE CALENDAR_YEAR = '2018'
		GROUP BY 1, 2),
		
	BEFORE_AFTER_CHANGE_2018 AS
	(SELECT SUM(CASE
					WHEN WEEK_NUMBER BETWEEN 21 AND 24 THEN TOTAL_SALES
					END) AS BEFORE_SALES_4WEEKS,
			SUM(CASE
					WHEN WEEK_NUMBER BETWEEN 26 AND 29 THEN TOTAL_SALES
					END) AS AFTER_SALES_4WEEKS,
